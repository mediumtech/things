You can also create pages manually (see below). \r\n\r\nYou can include links <https://github.com/>.\r\n\r\nAnd images [Mote](http://www.lhtrevail.co.uk/projects/motes/assets/abandon_500.jpg) .\r\n[My Unicorn](https://github.com/unicorn.png) . But not embedded (although there may well be a way to do this). \r\n\r\nBut you could do all of that using HTML, and possibly Jekyll which I can look into.\r\n\r\nBut is there an advantage to this over the existing site at the moment?\r\n\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
